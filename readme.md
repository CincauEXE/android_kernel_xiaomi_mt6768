# info kernels
* Stock Mod : 
    * same as stock kernels
    * add TTL support
    * add wireguard support

# info kernels will come maybe
* Neutrino-N : 
    * Underclock CPU Big freq minimal from 850Mhz to 500Mhz
    * just normal kernel

* Neurtino-X (maybe):
    * Underclock CPU Big freq minimal from 850Mhz to 500Mhz
    * Use max GPU freq same as merlin (from 950Mhz to 1Ghz)
    * maybe for gayming, but idk
    
* Neurtino-XT  (maybe again):
    * Underclock CPU Big freq minimal from 850Mhz to 500Mhz
    * Use max GPU freq same as merlin (from 950Mhz to 1Ghz)
    * OC CPU ???
    * maybe for gayming again, but idk
